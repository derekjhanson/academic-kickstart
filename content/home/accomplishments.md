  description = "When students read to learn, many thoughts can cross their mind. Am I understanding this? Will I remember it later? Is this too difficult? What did I just read? These thoughts influence our learning, cueing us to stop reading when we are satisfied, or go back when our goals are not met yet. Despite significant reading comprehension research, little is known about the thoughts learners have when reading and how these influence behavior (metacomprehension and judgments of learning)."

  description = "Students become familiar with the education system over time, eventually completing many familiar (fluent) tasks on "auto-pilot". This shallow processing can lead to mistakes and lower levels of learning. This experiment examines the impact of simple changes to a familiar object (a paper-based test) on student performance. Possible related individual differences, such as Need for Cognition, are examined for relationships with performance, as well."
