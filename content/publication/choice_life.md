abstract = "Surrounded by choices in our everyday lives, their ubiquity hides a series of important questions about the characteristics of these choices. Each day, students encounter choices in many domains of their lives -- these include at school, with friends, in extracurricular activities, at home, and in their leisure time. While research exists demonstrating the benefits of choice in school (e.g., Patall, Cooper, & Wynn, 2010), how do these choices compare to those available outside the classroom? Are choices present at the same levels in each area of our lives? Do they provide the same benefits?"
