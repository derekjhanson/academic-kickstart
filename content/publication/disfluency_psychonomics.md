abstract = "Metacomprehension research typically focuses on a single cue reported by readers, yet we know that readersâ€™ judgments can be influenced by multiple cues (Jaeger, 2012). In the present study, participants read a series of text passages on astrological phenomena, made metacomprehension judgments, reported and weighted the cues they used to make their judgments, and then took a comprehension test. We categorized these cues as relating to shallow processing (fluency, effort), to deep processing (summarizing, visualizing), or to prior knowledge and beliefs (self-efficacy, interest). The majority (66%) reported using multiple cues. Overall, readers relied most on shallow processing cues, followed by deep processing cues, and finally prior experiences. Although subject to self-report limitations, regression analyses yielded interesting patterns: those who reported just a single cue, who relied on prior knowledge, or who reported using the deep processing cues scored higher on the final test. Deep processing cues also typically related to higher JOLs, but not to metacognitive accuracy. Self-efficacy and effort were also related to JOLs, but not to test performance, resulting in overconfidence (self-efficacy) or underconfidence (effort)."
