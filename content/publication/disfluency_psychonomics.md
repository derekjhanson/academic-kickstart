abstract = "Knowing what to expect and the fluency that comes along with it is highly adaptive—it affords quick decision making and automatic responses. In classroom settings, however, this quickness can lead students into making silly mistakes. Research on disfluency shows that disrupting norms and expectations can shift people out of their associative, heuristic thinking and into a more systematic mode of thinking (e.g., Mourey, Lam, & Oyserman, 2015). In the present study, we examine whether a simple disruption to expectations—stapling the pages of a test packet in the wrong corner—can engage systematic thinking. We gave participants a series of cognitive reflection test (CRT) questions and measured need for cognition (NFC). The packet of questions were either stapled in the top left corner (control, fluent) or in the top right corner (disfluent). Those in the disfluent condition were more likely to answer the questions correctly, but significant differences between conditions existed only for participants with a low need for cognition."
